# Convolutional Neural Networks used

This diectory holds all the code realted to mode training, evaluation and validation of each individual CNN used.

- The Dataset used cannot be uploaded on github so here is the google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iuPCBKu8b9M1mvfDDj8hZtyygWQzFDjN?usp=sharing) to the dataset.

### The CNNs used are:

- DensNet121
- DensNet169
- DensNet201
- EfficientNet B7
- EfficientNet B3
- EfficientNet B0
- ResNet 152
- Inception V3
- VGG-19
- VGG-16
- Xception

Additionally ImageAllignment.py file is also added which contains the code for image allignment of retinal images so pattern recognition is easier.
